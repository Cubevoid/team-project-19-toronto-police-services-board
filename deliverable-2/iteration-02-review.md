## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect
When: Oct 31 2021
Where: Online
## Process - Reflection
### Q1. Decisions that turned out well
Making regular meetings and supporting those without previous experience allowed us to ensure that every member of the group got on track well, and is in good shape to work for the next deliverable.

Using Trello gave some idea of guidance for what we were doing for deliverable 2. This was useful to some extent for keeping on track, although perhaps not used as effectively as it could be. https://trello.com/b/YHNGEgzD/workflow.  

### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
We learned apis as we worked on deliverable 2. Thus we did not design apis ahead of time, and there was limited testing, with none written before some code. It would have been far more effective to plan and make tests for the API ahead of time, as it resulted in a lot of back and forth for frontend and backend.

Many people using the same feature branches at once. This resulted in merges while people were still working on it, some minor lost work and some confusion.

No deployed version until late in the process which meant minimal testing of the production environment. Partially due to backend and frontend being done simultaneously. This resulted in a lot of confusion close to the deadline.
### Q3. Planned changes
List any process-related (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)
Ordered from most to least important.
Explain why you are making a change.
More detailed Trello board (using meetings to decide many smaller tasks), that are more modular. To give a better, more specific idea of what is being worked on, and less non-descriptive general tasks.

Planning out anything that requires interaction between backend and frontend fully before starting development. Unplanned development due to lack of knowledge in certain areas resulted in, essentially chaos, which was not very productive.

Only one person to one branch per features, so branches, changes and cooperation is modular and more agile.

Plan to have a bare minimum deployed version farther ahead of the deadline. This will allow for effective QA testing, and a clear idea of possible next steps for the product.
